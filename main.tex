\subsection{Regress the variable $survived$ on $female$. Report and interpret the estimated (marginal) “effect” of being female.}
\input{OUTPUT/ols_a.tex}
The dependent variable $survived$ is a binary variable. We are thus in the binary outcome framework. In this question we perform an OLS regression of the $survived$
variable on the $female$ variable. The average survival rate was $0.191$ (see Table \ref{olsa}) while a woman would survive with a probability $0.191 + 0.536 = 0.727$.
Being a female increases your probability of survival by $0.536$. As the $female$ variable is binary, those numbers can be interpreted as probabilities. The result is very significant, being a female on board dramatically increased your chances of survival.

\subsection{Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the estimated (marginal) effect.}
Using the robust estimated variance we find a confidence interval at the 95\% level for the estimated marignal effect equal to $[0.488, 0.585]$.

\subsection{Repeat (a) using the probit. What do you find ? Are you surprised ?}
\input{OUTPUT/probit_c.tex}
We observe that the model now gives us a negative constant term. The coefficient of interest in the probit regression is $\beta = 1.479$ (see Table \ref{prbtc}) which means that the marginal effect is positive which was expected, this is not the marginal effect however. Using the margins package, we find a marginal effect of $0.434$. Those results do not seem very surprising, the average marginal effect is lower than the one OLS came up with however. 

\stepcounter{subsection}
\subsection{Continuing with the probit model from (c), add a numeric copy of the variable pclass to the “regression”. Interpret your results.}
As in the previous question, we find a significant positive impact of being a female on board, with a significant negative impact of the new $pclass$ variable (see Table \ref{prbte}). Using the library margins, we find a marginal effect of $0.406$ for the female variable and $-0.133$ for the $pclass$ variable. The intuition is clear, the $pclass$ goes from $1$ to $3$ from the most expensive seat to the cheapest. Being in first class increased your chances of surival by a significant amount, but still less than being a female. Leonardo Dicaprio increased both coefficients in absolute value even though their was enough space on this little piece of wood...
\input{OUTPUT/probit_e.tex}

\subsection{Instead of adding a numeric copy of the variable pclass to the regression in (c), add the variable pclass to it (pclass is coded as a “factor”). Interpret your results.}
This time the models estimates two coefficients for two dummy variables, $pclass2$ which is equal to $1$ when the passager is in second class, and similarly for $pclass3$. This regression adds information to the previous one as only one coefficient was used to describe an incrementation in the pclass variable. Results are displayed in Table \ref{prbtf}. We see that, as expected, the cheaper the seat you bought, the less chances of survival you had. Using the library margins, I find a marginal effect of $0.406$ for the female variable, as before, $-0.169$ for the $pclass2$ variable and $-0.295$ for the $pclass3$ variable. It means that the impact from moving from first class to the third is about twice as bad as moving from first class to the second. Put otherwise, the effect of a one unit incrementation of the pclass variable seems constant.
\input{OUTPUT/probit_f.tex}

\subsection{The model in (e) constitutes a restricted version of the model in (f). What is the restriction? Test it using a LR test. What do you find?}
The model estimated in question (f) writes
$$\mathbb{P}(survived = 1 | female, pclass) = \phi(\alpha + \beta_1 female + \beta_2 pclass2 + \beta_3 pclass 3)$$
while the model the model in question (e) imposes the restriction $\beta_3 = 2 \beta_2$.
Performing the LR test using the lrtest function from the lmtest package, we find that the number of interest is 0.16 derived from a $\chi^2(1)$ distribution under the null. This value is below the rejection threshold at the 10 \% level, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

\stepcounter{subsection}
\subsection{Starting with your model specification in (e), add the variable $fare$. Use the Wald test and the LR test to test whether the coefficient on $fare$ is equal to zero. What do you find?}
\input{OUTPUT/probit_i.tex}
The LR does not reject the null as the outcome of the $\chi^2(1)$ distribution is $0.59$ and is below the rejection threshold at the 10 \% level meaning that the $fare$ coefficient is not statstically different from 0. We see in Table \ref{prbti} that the coefficient is not significant at the 10 \% level according to the Wald test automatically performed. Both tests fail to reject the null. The variable $fare$ does not seem to have any impact on the survival rate on board.

\subsection{Starting with your model specification in (e), add the variable age. Compute the partial effect of age for a female passenger in 1st class with “average” age.}
\input{OUTPUT/probit_j.tex}
Denoting $\bar{age}$ as the mean age of the population and denoting the model
$$\mathbb{P}(survived = 1 | female, pclass, age) = \phi(\alpha + \beta_1 female + \beta_2 pclass + \beta_3 age),$$ the partial marginal impact of age 
the partial marginal impact of interest is given by $\beta_3 \phi(\alpha + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 \bar{age})$ and we find $-0.0176$.

\subsection{Using your model specification in (j), compute the average partial effect of age. What do you find?}
Computing the average marginal effect using the predicition package, I find $-0.007$.

\subsection{Using your model specification in (j), plot the sorted marginal effect of age. What do you find ?}

  \end{figure}
In figure \ref{fig:sorted_marginal_effect}, we find that the marginal is not constant and varies from $0$ to $0.015$ in absolute value. Plotting the marginal effect with respect to $age$ for each subgroup of people (see figure \ref{fig:marginal_effect_age}) shows that the marginal effect of the age on the survival rate is descreasing in absolute value with respect to age after controlling for gender and $pclass$.
